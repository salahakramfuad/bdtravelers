						<h2>Water your travel seed:</h2>
						<p>
							Written By Mohammad Salah Akram Fuad

							Travel - A Matter of Courage
							"Twenty years from now, you will be more disappointed by the things you did not do than the ones you did.
							So throw off
							the bowlines, and sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sail, explore, dream,
							discover." —Mark
							Twain. We have read in high school books about the verdant nature of Bangladesh, but how many of us have
							shown the
							courage to explore it? When it comes to traveling, many people put money first, but the hunger to explore
							nature is
							required the most. The famous writer Paulo Coelho says, "Travel is never a matter of money but courage."
							The tourism
							sector in Bangladesh has grown far less than it should have in the past 50 years. Over the past years,
							there has been a
							gradual increase in tourists at the main attraction points, Cox's Bazar, Saint Martin’s, and Sylhet.
							Traveling in
							Bangladesh is pretty cost-effective if you only know how to deal with people and how to negotiate.

							A Traveling Experience to Cherish
							I will always cherish the day, October 25, 2021, when Junayed, Shakib, and I settled upon leaving for
							Kuakata that
							evening. We had a tight budget but decided to give it a go. We decided to meet at Sadarghat. According to
							the plan, I
							packed a little bag and headed for Sadarghat at around 3:00. After gathering at around 5 pm, we started
							searching for a
							launch that would travel to Kuakata. Someone at the terminal suggested that we catch a launch to
							Khepupara. We hurriedly
							boarded as soon as we found our giant water ride. When boarding, we learned that the fare is comparatively
							lower at the
							deck, with no seats available. Like many others, we grabbed some space for our group of three.

							We had already bought some loaves of bread and bananas for the night as food prices are very high at the
							canteen. It was
							my first experience with this mode of transport, and I loved it. Standing at the front of the launch,
							sipping tea from
							paper cups, sailing through the dark, and the chilly wind brushing my face was an unforgettable
							experience. Brave
							fishers catch fish in the middle of the river with a tiny boat and a little light source as the water
							monsters pass by,
							giving a close call. We enjoyed a sunrise as pretty as a picture from the ride near the Payra port.

							When the launch reached its destination Khepupara, a terminal not as spacious as Sadarghat, it was almost
							7 am. We got
							off and entered a local restaurant for breakfast, and the food prices were lower than in Dhaka. We
							bargained with a
							charger vehicle owner for a ride to Kuakata for 60 BDT each, and we had to cross three medium-length
							bridges to reach
							our destination. We started searching for hotels as soon as we arrived. We finally found ourselves in an
							inexpensive
							hotel near the beach, and our bill for one night was only 500 BDT. This trip would have been much more
							expensive if we
							did not know how to negotiate.

							Inhalation of Day One in Kuakata
							We noticed two bikers following us as we left the hotel, offering us rides to some attractions around
							here. They ask for
							a very high amount of money for a small ride, which they do not mention. It is better to avoid the trap.
							We politely
							rejected them and walked towards the Bay of Bengal. We rented two beach chairs and enjoyed the scenario we
							craved as the
							cool breeze welcomed us. An hour later, we started walking along the beach. The walk along the beach was
							fascinating,
							with lots of seashells waiting to be collected, trollers lining up along the beach as the fishing season
							had ended, and
							lots of tree logs washing ashore, making quite an impactful sound when hitting the wet sand below them.

							We returned to the starting point of our walk and had a great time with the tide. Going into the water
							when people are
							around is always a wise idea. We returned to the hotel, changed our clothes, and headed to a restaurant
							for lunch. In
							the afternoon, we hired a van to take us to Lebuchar. We went for the sunset and watched as it slowly
							descended into
							waves crashing against sand while golden sparkles were seen dancing across its surface like stars in
							space.

							We left the spot as soon as the last ray of sunlight faded, and it is always better not to stay in unknown
							places after
							sunset. We had fish BBQ, crab fries, and shrimp at night. Fish BBQ is a must-try item for anyone who
							visits here. Crab
							and shrimp taste similar. The price depends on the kind of fish and its size. Many jewelry items are made
							of sea
							creatures, and the clothing prices are lower than in Dhaka. We bought two beautiful handmade chadors for
							200 and 550
							BDT. We got back to the hotel at around 10 p.m.

							The Fatigued Camera Was Not Permitted to Have Any Leisure in Kuakata.
							The following day, we got up early before sunrise and hired two bikes at BDT 500 each. Bikes drove through
							the low
							light, leaving tire prints on the sand. The only sounds we could hear were the pounding of the surf and
							the noise from
							the engine. We could see that many people had already arrived to enjoy the glorious moment of the sun
							rising. The sky
							turned red, making the scene cinematic as the sun emerged from the water. The pounding of the surf and
							birds chirping
							enhanced the moment. We spent some time walking around the beach, capturing the beautiful moments. The
							poor shutter was
							not permitted to have any leisure on the way back, capturing some of the most spectacular moments my eyes
							have ever
							witnessed. At the same time, our bulky pockets were busy preserving a plethora of nostalgic seashells.
							After having
							breakfast, we laid down on the moist, hard sand while our shades protected our eyes from the scorching sun
							and enjoyed
							the beautiful weather while drinking green coconut. We got into the water for the last time on this trip
							and had a
							wonderful time. At around 12, we checked out of the hotel, had lunch, and headed for the launch in Dhaka.
							We arrived at
							Sadarghat the following day after a 15-hour journey. The whole 2-day trip costs approximately 2200 BDT for
							each person,
							including everything.

							The Final Thought on Traveling
							The great thing about traveling is how it helps us escape from our regular lives, which can be stressful.
							Traveling once
							or twice a year has enhanced creativity and workability. Being limited by the 9 to 5 lifestyle can make us
							feel like we
							have no control over what happens next.

							We will regret not taking a trip like this at some point down the line. So, when possible, water your
							travel seed in
							your mind and let the thoughts of Bangladesh fill you with wanderlust. The country has so much to offer,
							from natural
							beauty to rich culture and history. Furthermore, its people are some of the warmest and most welcoming you
							will ever
							meet.

							So what are you waiting for? Start planning your trip to explore Bangladesh today. Just be sure to do your
							part to keep
							the country clean by not littering. After all, happy travels start with respecting the places we visit.
